# `Further thoughts regarding the App`

If I had further time to develop this app, these are some of the things that I would change and/or continue to develop:

- For this app, I have used an online converter to turn the CSV files into JSON. Ideally, with more time available, I would write something to handle the conversion within the app itself.

- In making the app as I have, I have made some assumptions about what the data is displaying. Ideally, I would consult with the data science team to ensure that I am optimally displaying the data and that any assumptions that I make regarding it are correct.

- I would add further reports so that Michael, or any other user, was getting more comprehensive data back

- I would further develop the suggestions table and endeavour to improve its readability, perhaps by making it or elements of it interactive

- I would further break down the components within the app to make it more user friendly for other developers

- I would make it responsive for viewing on different devices such as mobile

- I would ensure that the code is fully typed with Typescript

- I would add further test coverage as currently there is only a single test of the `compare` helper function

- I would endeavour to make the entire app more closely adhere to the wireframe provided by the design team. Ideally, I would collaborate with them to achieve this
